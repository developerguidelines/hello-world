# Introduction

The  make  program  is  intended  to  automate the process of transform a set of
source  code  file into a functioning executable program. Here is an explanation
of this [book][Book]

                    "The  make  program  is  intended  to  automate  the mundane
                    aspects  of transforming source code into an executable. The
                    advantages  of make over scripts is that you can specify the
                    relationships between the elements of your program to make ,
                    and  it  knows  through  these  relationships and timestamps
                    exactly  what steps need to be redone to produce the desired
                    program  each  time.  Using  this information, make can also
                    opti-  mize  the  build process avoiding unnecessary steps."
